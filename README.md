Alvin Chan Man Lung, currently age 18 as of 2015. Born 13th March. Youngest of two siblings. Currently residing in Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. Prospective students in the field of Pharmaceutical Research. Future ambitions are possibly to find cure for diseases such as cancer. In hopes, I may one day, contribute to the society and the world. I have been many complacent and oblivious to matters throughout my life. Having no responsibilities, being pampered and so forth. Upon my grandfather's, aunt's and father's demise before turning 14, I learned the hardships of life. Money, relationships, responsibilities and of course, my future. Sports, definitely my passion. I've played hockey, basketball and futsal. But the most memorable sport I've played is rugby. Having physical contact, withstanding pain and extensively difficult training helped me boost my own confidence. In reality, I am extremely introverted. Talking infront of a crowd is nerve-wrecking. But that does not mean I should be bad at it. Over the course of years, I've developed myself by opening up myself to God and my friends. I would categorize myself as a pessimist. I tend to think of the worst possible outcome to lower my expectations. However, to counteract with that side of myself, I am a sore loser. I tend to give credit to myself by working hard mostly because it feels good to prevail from dire situations.
